    "activation='relu')`\n",

    "\n",
    "`output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having 16 hidden units means that the weight matrix `W` will have shape `(input_dimension, 16)`, i.e. the dot product with `W` will project the \n",
    "input data onto a 16-dimensional representation space (and then we would add the bias vector `b` and apply the `relu` operation). You can \n",
    "intuitively understand the dimensionality of your representation space as \"how much freedom you are allowing the network to have when \n",
    "learning internal representations\". Having more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation space) allows your network to learn more \n",
    "complex representations, but it makes your network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns (patterns that \n",

    "and a third layer which will output the scalar prediction regarding the sentiment of the current review. \n",

    "(a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target \"1\", i.e. how likely the review is to be positive). \n",
    "A `relu` (rectified linear unit) is a function meant to zero-out negative values, \n",

    "\n",
    "* There's usually quite a bit of preprocessing you need to do on your raw data in order to be able to feed it -- as tensors -- into a neural \n",
    "network. In the case of sequences of words, they can be encoded as binary vectors -- but there are other encoding options too.\n",
    "* Stacks of `Dense` layers with `relu` activations can solve a wide range of problems (including sentiment classification), and you will \n",
    "likely use them frequently.\n",
    "* In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a `Dense` layer with 1 unit and a `sigmoid` activation, \n",
    "i.e. the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
    "* With such a scalar sigmoid output, on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is `binary_crossentropy`.\n",
    "* The `rmsprop` optimizer is generally a good enough choice of optimizer, whatever your problem. That's one less thing for you to worry \n",
    "about.\n",
    "* As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start _overfitting_ and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data \n",
    "never-seen-before. Make sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n"
